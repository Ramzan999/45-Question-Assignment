// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names: string[] = ["Ali", "Khalid", "Ramiz", "Ahsan"];

for (let name of names) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}, You are most wellcome in TypeScript Programming Language.`)
}
